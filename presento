## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **Azure Synapse SQL** – centralized Teams CDR data source
* **Python Modular Pipeline**:

  * pandas, scikit-learn, pyodbc
  * ML Models: Isolation Forest, XGBoost, Prophet
* **Business Rule Configuration** via `business_rules.json`
* **Power BI** for visualizing alert intelligence

---

## 📦 Intelligent Alert Structure

* Grouped by `Second Reflexive Local IP Network`
* Each alert includes:

  * Total anomaly count and affected dates
  * Count of users, subnets, and conferences (>100 participants)
  * Breakdown of Media Types (Audio/Video/VBSS)
  * Network types (Wired/Wifi)
  * VDI version (1.0 / 2.0) distribution
  * Most affected capture and render devices
  * Poor feedback and sentiment analysis
  * Forecast patterns and remediation suggestions

---

## 🔮 Forecasting & Feedback Analysis

* **Prophet model** used to forecast:

  * When issues might re-occur
  * Volume of anomalies over time
* **Feedback analysis**:

  * Poor rating count per UPN/subnet
  * Sentiment review from feedback text (if any)

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboards

* Visualize alerts by Reflexive IP
* Subnet heatmaps and user impact
* Device type issue trends
* Daily & weekly forecast patterns
* Easily filterable by country, region, or department

---

## ✅ Threshold-Based Clustered Anomaly Alerts

* Alerts are only generated for systemic issues affecting large groups.
* Strict thresholds defined in `business_rules.json` must be met:

  * Users Affected ≥ 100
  * Subnets Affected ≥ 20
* Uses clustering logic grouped by Second Reflexive Local IP Network.
* Prevents noise from isolated or low-impact incidents.
* Enhances accuracy and prioritization of IT response.

## 🚀 Scalability & Value to Organization

* Config-driven thresholds (jitter, round trip, packet loss, feedback)
* Focused only on **high-impact, systemic issues**
* Easily extendable to:

  * Additional KPIs or media types
  * Device-level diagnostics
  * Department-based reporting
* Enables proactive remediation, not just reactive support
